# Master-Slave-Robotic-Arm
This repository is intended to provide the basic working code for master slave robotic arm using arduino uno.

This is the basic code for master slave robotic arm made by me with my group during my final year B.E. project work.
The microcontroller used is a standard Arduino Uno.
It uses PWM signals from the master ARM and converts them to digital signals in the controller which are fed to slave arm.
